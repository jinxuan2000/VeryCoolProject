## Project description
Hello, below are some basic notes on running the app locally <br/>
and basic version controll operations with git.

## How to run on local env
1. Open gitbash terminal <br/>
2. cd webproject/webproject-react/src <br/>
3. run npm start <br/>

## Version control notes
!!!DO NOT SIMPLY MODIFY MASTER!!! <br/>
When starting on a new feature or major function, branch off of development first. <br/>
1. git branch - Check your working branch <br/>
2. git status - Check your current edits <br/>
3. git log - Check the commit logs for the branch <br/>
4. git pull - Fetches, downloads and merges pulled remote branch with your local <br/>
5. git add __ - Adds changes you have made to be commited <br/>
6. git commit - Commits you added changes <br/>
7. git push origin - Pushed commited changes from local to remote <br/>
